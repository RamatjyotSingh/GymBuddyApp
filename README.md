## Vision Statement
Gym Buddy is a workout assistant app designed to help users stay organized and motivated on their fitness journey. It helps to simplify tracking workouts and setting goals by keeping all workout data in one easy-to-use platform. With features that allow users to create customized workout routines, set achievable targets, and monitor their progress, Gym Buddy serves as a useful companion for anyone looking to enhance their fitness journey. 

The primary audience for Gym Buddy consists of athletes, gym-goers, and university students who are looking for a streamlined approach to tracking and managing their workouts. Often, these users find themselves jumping between multiple apps or relying on outdated methods like notebooks and spreadsheets to monitor their fitness progress. Gym Buddy replaces the hassle of juggling different tools by providing everything they need in one app, making the process simpler and more efficient. Whether it’s a seasoned athlete aiming for personal records or a university student just starting their fitness journey, Gym Buddy is designed to accommodate users at all experience levels. 

The app’s core features revolve around accessibility and customization. Users can build workouts using a library of predefined exercises or create their own custom exercises to reflect their unique training routines. Gym Buddy’s "live workout mode," provides users with real-time information about their performance. This includes data such as the last time an exercise was performed, the weight used, the number of sets and repetitions completed, and the user’s recorded Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). By giving users immediate access to this information, Gym Buddy helps them make informed decisions during workouts, ensuring steady progress toward their fitness goals. 

Gym Buddy stands out because it helps users reflect on their fitness journey while planning for future progress. By giving users detailed insights into their performance and achievements, the app encourages them to set clear, achievable goals and track their improvement over time. Its straightforward and intuitive design makes it easy to use, even for beginners, while still providing the advanced features that experienced athletes expect. This combination of simplicity and functionality makes Gym Buddy a valuable tool for anyone serious about improving their fitness. 

The success of Gym Buddy will be evaluated through measurable and objective criteria. First, the app aims to achieve an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher, with a significant number of reviews within the first six months of release. In addition, user surveys will assess satisfaction with the app’s ability to track progress, set goals, and improve workouts. Engagement metrics, such as the number of active users and the frequency of workouts logged, will also be monitored. If most users report that Gym Buddy has helped them stay organized, motivated, and on track to achieve their fitness goals, the project will be considered a success. 

Gym Buddy is designed to make fitness tracking simple and effective for everyone. By focusing on customization, ease of use, and meaningful insights, this app is built to support users at every stage of their fitness journey and help them reach their full potential.
