# Iteration 1 Retrospective Meeting

**Meeting Time:** Feb 14, 2025, 10:00 - 10:20 AM

**Attendees:** Evan, Logan, & Ty

One of the main challenges we faced was time management, as we often found ourselves working too close to deadlines instead of starting earlier. While we met the final deadline, we missed our internal goal of finishing 24 hours in advance, which left little room for last-minute adjustments. Communication was another issue, as sometimes important changes would be made without much warning. Often, people would make decisions for themselves and not take into consideration what other people are doing. Additionally, our workflow felt disorganized at times, making it difficult to stay aligned. To improve, we recognize the need for more frequent online meetings, better planning, more accountability with each other about what each of us are doing, and a higher degree of awareness for the people in the team.

Despite these challenges, several things worked well for our team. Using [When2Meet](when2meet.com) made it easier to schedule meetings that accommodated everyone, and the meetings themselves were valuable for getting help and feedback. Sharing screens during discussions helped us collaborate more effectively, and while in-person meetings would have been ideal, we adapted well to the online format. Having a shared [Draw.io](draw.io) workspace was especially useful for visually organizing and sharing ideas. We intend to continue with these practices to support communication within the team.
